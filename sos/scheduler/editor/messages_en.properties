# Fenster Job Wizard -- Übersicht
assistent.start.info=The Wizard creates a new job element based on an already documented standard job.\n\nThe following steps will be carried out when creating this new element:\n\n1. Stand-alone job or order controlled job?\n2. Select job\n3. Take over job parameters\n4. Parallel execution of tasks\n5. Job implementation\n6. Timeout/ Idle Timeout\n7. Start times/ Directory monitoring\n8. Restarting a job after an error (delay after error)\n9. Delayed repetition of set back orders (delay after setback)\n\nThe "Show" button is used to display the job element XML configuration in its "as-is" state - i.e. as currently specified in the Wizard.\n\nThe "Next" button accepts the parameters specified in the current form before opening the next one.\n\nThe "Finish" button is used to save the job in its current state.
assistent.start.info.visible=Do not show this window in the future.
assistent.cancel=Leave this wizard without saving?
assistent.finish=Complete the wizard - the new job will be shown in the Job Editor.
assistent.end=You have completed the wizard - the new job will be shown in Job Editor.

# Fenster Job Type -- Schritt 1
assistent.type=Jobs can be triggered by explicit job starts or by an order (order controlled jobs).\n\nJobs which are order controlled always belong to a job chain. Such jobs are started as soon as an order arrives. Please note that a job chain in which the job is run must be defined.\n\nStand-alone jobs are started at a particular time or by directory monitoring.\n\nShould the new job be order controlled or not?
assistent.type.standalonejob=Stand-alone job
assistent.order.orderjob=Order controlled job

# Fenster Import Job -- Schritt 2
assistent.import_jobs=Standard jobs generated from the job documentation are saved in the <scheduler-installation_directory>/jobs directory.\n\nThis window lists all documented standard jobs available for use for your implementation.\nA new job can be created with the properties of a selected standard job.\n\nClick on a job in the list, enter a name for the new job and, if required, overwrite its title.\n\nClicking the "Description" button then opens the description of the new job in a browser window. 
assistent.error.no_job_selected=Please select a job from the list.
assistent.error.no_jobname=Please give this job a name.
assistent.error.job_name_exist=This job name already exists.

# Fenster Job Parameter -- Schritt 3
assistent.parameters=The job documentation sets the formal job parameters. This window shows a list of these parameters together with their names and default values. In addition, the parameter description from the job documentation are shown when available.\n\nParameters can be taken over individually or all together. Obligatory parameters are marked in yellow and must be taken over.\n\nClicking on a parameter causes the parameter name and value to be copied into the respective upper editing windows, where they can be modified as required and then saved using the "Apply" button. You can also use these windows to enter specific parameters values for the job in question and confirm these with "Apply".

# Fenster Tasks -- Schritt 4
assistent.tasks=You can explicitly specify the maximum number of tasks which a job can carry out in parallel.\n\n Should no value be entered here, then the default Job Scheduler maximum value of "1" will be used. This means that tasks will not be executed in parallel.\n\nIn addition, you can specify the minimum number of tasks which are to run. Please note that this minimum number may not be larger than the maximum number of tasks.
assistent.min_tasks=The minimum number of tasks to be run at any one time.
assistent.error.min_task_too_large=The minimum number of tasks may not be larger than the maximum number allowed.

# Fenster Execute (Script/Process) -- Schritt 5
#assistent.script=Jobs can be implemented in different ways: using a Java or Com class, or with JavaScript, VBScript, PerlScript or a shell script.\n\nThe job you have selected uses a Java class.\nThe Java archive specified as a resource must be specified in the Java class path.
assistent.script.java=Jobs can be implemented in different ways: using a Java or Com class, or with JavaScript, VBScript, PerlScript or a shell script.\n\nThe job you have selected uses a Java class.\nThe Java archive specified as a resource must be specified in the Java class path.
assistent.script.com=This job has been implemented using a Com class.
assistent.script.javascript=This job has been implemented using JavaScript.
assistent.script.perlscript=This job has been implemented using PerlScript.
assistent.script.vbscript=This job has been implemented using VBScript.
assistent.script.shell=This job has been implemented using a shell script.
assistent.process=The following process has been set up:

# Fenster Timeout -- Schritt 6
assistent.timeout=Timeout limits the length of time a processing step can last. After a timeout has been exceeded, the Job Scheduler stops the task in question.\n\nThe timeout can be specified in seconds or in the HH:MM or HH:MM:SS formats.
#assistent.timeout.order=Timeout beschränkt die Dauer eines Verarbeitungsschritts. Nach Ablauf der Timeout-Zeit beendet der Scheduler eine Task.\n\nIdle Timeout begrenzt den Leerlauf eines auftragsgesteuerten Jobs. Wenn eine Task auf den nächsten Auftrag wartet und in dieser Frist kein Auftrag eintrifft, beendet der Scheduler diese Task.\n\nTimeout/ Idle Timeout kann in Sekunden oder im Format HH:MM oder HH:MM:SS angegegeben werden.\n\nForce Idle Timeout wirkt zusammen mit Minimum Tasks und vereinbart, dass nach Ablauf des angegebenen Idle Timeout eine Task beendet und neu gestartet wird, wenn die mit Minimum Tasks angegebene Anzahl aktiver Tasks nicht erreicht ist.
assistent.timeout.order=Timeout restricts the duration of a processing step. After the timeout has been exceeded, the Job Scheduler stops the task in question.\n\nIdle Timeout limits the length of time a order controlled job can be idle. When a task is waiting on its next order and no order arrives in the period specified, then the Job Scheduler ends the task.\n\nTimeout/ Idle Timeout can be specified in seconds or in HH:MM or HH:MM:SS formats.\n\nForce Idle Timeout ends the task after Idle-Timeout has expired, even when this means that less than the number of tasks specfied in min_task will be running. New tasks will be directly started by the Job Scheduler as required.

# Fenster Run Options -- Schritt 7
assistent.run_options=How should the job be started?\n\nPeriods can be defined - i.e. blocks of time within which tasks may run.\n\nExplicit start times can be specified for stand-alone jobs.\n\nStand-alone jobs can also be triggered by directory monitoring. In this case, the Job Scheduler starts a job as soon as a file is either added to or deleted from the directory or directories being monitored.

# Fenster Run Options/ Periods -- Schritt 7a###
assistent.period=Periods specify blocks of time in which a job may run tasks. Periods cover a block of time within a single day.\n\nA period is defined by specifying its start and end times.\n\nJobs for which no period has been set may start at anytime. Should a start time be specified for a job but no end time then the job can run until 24:00. Should no start time be specified for a job, then it may start at 00:00.\n\nThe tabs below can be used to define more than one period when a job can run - e.g. for particular days in the week or month.\n\nA "Repeat" interval can be specified for stand-alone jobs, after which the job can be repeated within a period.\n\n"Let Run" can be used to allow a stand-alone job to continue running (to completion) although its run period has come to an end.

# Fenster Run Options/ Single Starts -- Schritt 7b
assistent.run_time=One or more start times can be specified here for a stand-alone job. The configuration allows the start times to be specified in different ways: \n for example, a job can start:\n- every day at a particular time \n- on a particular day of the month, at a particular time\n- on a particular day of the week, at a particular time\n- on both the first and the last day of the month at a particular time.\n\nFurther start times can be specified and/or edited in the job detail view.
assistent.no_time=This is an invalid time format.

# Fenster Run Options/ Directory Monitoring -- Schritt 7c
assistant.directory_monitoring=Specify one or more directories which are to be monitored by the Job Scheduler.\n\nA regular expression can be specified for the file names relevant for each directory. Only files, whose names correspond with this expression will be acted on by the Job Scheduler.\n\nThe job will be started as soon as a change occurs in the directory - that is, a file is either added to or deleted from the directory.

# Fenster Delays -- Schritt 8
#assistent.delay_after_info_global=Should an error occur whilst a job is being carried out, the Job Scheduler will stop the job. You can define delays - delayed job starts - after which the job will be restarted.\n\nIn addition, setback delays can be specified for order controlled jobs.
# Fenster Job Delay after Error  -- Schritt 8a
assistent.delay_after_error=The Job Scheduler stops a job should an error occur whilst it is being carried out. A delay modifies this behavior: the job is restarted after the delay.\n\nYou can specify more than one delay and the number of errors for which each delay should be applied - i.e. 10s delay should be applied for 10 successive errors.\nIn addition, the number of errors which may occur before the job is completely stopped can be set.\n\nFurther delays scaling the frequency of restarts in the event of errors can be defined in the detailed job view.
assistent.delay_after_error.time=After which delay should the job be restarted?
assistent.delay_after_error.time.missing=Specify a delay interval.
assistent.delay_after_error.error_count=For how many errors should this delay apply?
assistent.delay_after_error.error_count.missing=Please specify the number of errors this delay should be applied to.
assistent.delay_after_error.stop_count=After how many errors should the job be stopped?

# Fenster Delay after SetBack  -- Schritt 8b
assistent.delay_order_after_setback=An order controlled job can defer an order currently being carried out. The deferred order will then be added at the last position in the job order queue and will be restarted after the time specified. The number of delays in carrying out an order occurring in series is counted.\n\n"Delay Order After Setback" can be used to set different delays after repeated setbacks.
assistent.delay_order_after_setback.time=After which delay should the order be restarted?
assistent.delay_order_after_setback.setback_count=How many setbacks should this delay be applied to?
assistent.delay_order_after_setback.is_maximum=Should this delay set the order in the error state?
assistent.no_numeric=Only numerical values are allowed here.
